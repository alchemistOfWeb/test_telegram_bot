# Simple hello-bot

Now it's a simple hello-bot
Perhaps, it will be changed in the future

## Getting started

Make a config.py file which contains the following code:
```python
TOKEN = 'your secret bot token'
```

Then you can start bot by the following command:
    `python3 main.py`

After that, bot is working.

To stop it you can use `Ctrl+c` in the console

## Bot can...
* Answer 'Hello' on each your text message
* Answer "I can't understand it" in other cases
